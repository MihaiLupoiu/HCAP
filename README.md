# High Performance Computing Tools (HCAP)
===================
Master's Degree in Parallel and Distributed Computing at Valencia (UPV)

This course was intended for students to learn to develop sequential code as efficient as possible. To do this, we have studied  the relationship between computer architecture and performance of programs, and the different techniques that can be applied to accelerate our codes. We also studied tools and libraries that can be used to develop efficient sequential code.

Learning Units:
-------------
> - Basics of High Performance Computing and linear algebra.
> - Programming languages for high performance computing.
> - Memory hierarchy. His influence and exploitation. Scalar algorithms and blocks.
> - Technical Storage Array (dense, structured, dispersed).
> - Computational kernels: BLAS, LAPACK
> - Optimization of code.
